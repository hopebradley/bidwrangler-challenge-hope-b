```npm start```

to access the frontend on local.

then, go into the rails_api directory and run

```rails s -p 5000```

to get the rails server up and running! the port is important, if it's not running on 5000 things won't work.

## Once you're in

```localhost:3000/auctioneer/YourName```

To enter in as a bidder, navigate to 
```localhost:3000/bidder/YourName```
